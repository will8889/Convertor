Revisions:
- Adjusted audio conversion to make it run faster
- Adjusted daily clear time to 4am to avoid 'accidents'

The 'accident':
this happen because we set it up to remove all file in the upload and output
folder since we use pythonanywhere for free and the storage is limited so we
set up a code in test.py where we use the task function of pythonanywhere so
the server will run it 1 time a day. Since the time zone is different in the
website, the clear.py run in 3 AM in the server which is 10 AM in WIB when we
are presenting our application, the converted file ended up deleted which is 
why we got an error where the url is not found.

CI/CD with github action:
Everytime there is a push in this convertor repo, the python-app.yml will run.
The CI will testing the installation of dependecies by using the requirement.txt,
test the syntax using python library flake8, and test the app.py by using pytest 
to test one of the function in it. If all three works without any error, it will 
start the CD process which is the deployment where it will send a POST request 
with webhook to convertorwebapp.pythonanywhere/update_server where it will receive 
and start to do a git pull. The next thing to do is to click reload button in the 
pythonanywhere web so to make it reload automatically, we create post-merge file 
with a bash command to reload the website in the .git/hooks folder where it will 
run everytime a merge happening. This works because git pull is basicly a 
fetch + merge and we just need to use a bash command in the pythonanywhere to make 
the program executeable.
